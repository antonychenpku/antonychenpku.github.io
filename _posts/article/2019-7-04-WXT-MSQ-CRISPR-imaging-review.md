#### Abstract:

Chromatin conformation, localization, and dynamics are crucial regulators of cellular behaviors. Although fluorescence in situ hybridization-based techniques have been widely utilized for investigating chromatin architectures in healthy and diseased states, the requirement for cell fixation precludes the comprehensive dynamic analysis necessary to fully understand chromatin activities. This has spurred the development and application of a variety of imaging methodologies for visualizing single chromosomal loci in the native cellular context. In this review, we describe currently-available approaches for imaging single genomic loci in cells, with special focus on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based imaging approaches. In addition, we discuss some of the challenges that limit the application of CRISPR-based genomic imaging approaches, and potential solutions to address these challenges. We anticipate that, with continued refinement of CRISPR-based imaging techniques, significant understanding can be gained to help decipher chromatin activities and their relevance to cellular physiology and pathogenesis.
