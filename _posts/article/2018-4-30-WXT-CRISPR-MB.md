#### Abstract:

The clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) gene-editing system has been repurposed for live-cell genomic imaging, but existing approaches rely on fluorescent protein reporters, making sensitive and continuous imaging difficult. Here, we present a fluorophore-based live-cell genomic imaging system that consists of a nuclease-deactivated mutant of the Cas9 protein (dCas9), a molecular beacon (MB), and an engineered single-guide RNA (sgRNA) harboring a unique MB target sequence (sgRNA-MTS), termed CRISPR/MB. Specifically, dCas9 and sgRNA-MTS are first co-expressed to target a specific locus in cells, followed by delivery of MBs that can then hybridize to MTS to illuminate the target locus. We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for quantifying genomic loci, for monitoring chromatin dynamics, and for dual-color imaging when using two orthogonal MB/MTS pairs. With flexibility in selecting different combinations of fluorophore/quencher pairs and MB/MTS sequences, our CRISPR/MB hybrid system could be a promising platform for investigating chromatin activities.
