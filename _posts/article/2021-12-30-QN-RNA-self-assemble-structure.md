#### Abstract:

Many pathological processes are driven by RNA-protein interactions, making such interactions promising targets for molecular interventions. HIV-1 assembly is one such process, in which the viral genomic RNA interacts with the viral Gag protein and serves as a scaffold to drive Gag multimerization that ultimately leads to formation of a virus particle. Here, we develop self-assembled RNA nanostructures that can inhibit HIV-1 virus assembly, achieved through hybridization of multiple artificial small RNAs with a stem–loop structure (STL) that we identify as a prominent ligand of Gag that can inhibit virus particle production via STL-Gag interactions. The resulting STL-decorated nanostructures (double and triple stem–loop structures denoted as Dumbbell and Tribell, respectively) can elicit more pronounced viral blockade than their building blocks, with the inhibition arising as a result of nanostructures interfering with Gag multimerization. These findings could open up new avenues for RNA-based therapy.
